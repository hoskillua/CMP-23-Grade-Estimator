# CMP-23-Grade-Estimator
A simple C++ program to predict total points (/750) given both academic grade &amp; optionally classwork for each subject as well as the rank (1-82)

It is very encouraged If you test it on last year's data. So, if any problems are found, please let me know so that they can be fixed as soon as possible 
Please note that this a very early version so there could be a lot to be added/fixed (eg, some more validations ..)
